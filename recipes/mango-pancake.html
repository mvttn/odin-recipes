    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Mango pancakes are thin yellow crepes rolled up like a spring roll with
      whipped cream and a big juicy piece of mango stuffed inside.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <h3>Pancake (crepe) batter</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Plain/all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>Icing sugar</li>
        <li>Cornflour/cornstarch</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Yellow food colouring</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Whipped cream filling</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Thickened/heavy cream or other whipping cream</li>
        <li>
          Icing sugar/powdered sugar - can use ordinary white sugar (just will
          take longer to dissolve)
        </li>
        <li>Vanilla extract</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Mango</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>2 of your favourite type of mango</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <h3>Batter</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Batter</strong> - Pour the milk into a bowl then sift the dry
          ingredients in (flour, cornflour, icing sugar). Whisk until lump free,
          then whisk in the eggs and food colouring. The batter will be very,
          very thin.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Refrigerate</strong> for 1 hour. Don't skip or shortcut this
          step as during this resting time, the flour absorbs liquid which makes
          the crepe softer so you can roll the crepes without cracking. Also,
          the batter thickens slightly to the right consistency for cooking.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Cook Pancakes (crepes)</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Measure out</strong> 45 ml / 3 tablespoons of batter.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Spray</strong> a non stick pan lightly with oil then heat over
          a medium low stove. Use an appropriately sized pan!
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Pour the batter</strong> evenly into the pan - should sizzle
          very lightly
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Set to touch</strong> - Cook for 45 seconds to 1 minute or
          until the middle is set to touch. Do not flip in the pan. We only cook
          one side of the crepes. The top side that is not in contact with the
          pan will be the presentation side of the mango pancake (smooth and
          untarnished!).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Loosen</strong> About halfway through cooking, start loosening
          the edges with a rubber spatula to ensure it flips out easily. Don't
          be shy about getting under those edges!
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Flip</strong> the crepe out onto a work surface. Flip quickly,
          and with confidence!
          <p>
            Don't worry if your crepes fold or wrinkle when they land. Just
            leave them while hot as they are quite delicate. They become less
            fragile as they cool, then you can straighten them out.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Repeat</strong> to cook remaining crepes. You should get 10 to
          12 in total. You can flip them out on top of each other, they will not
          stick because of the oil.
          <p>
            <strong>Fully cool</strong> before filling (about 30 minutes) else
            the cream will melt.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Assembling</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Filling</strong> initial-scale Place crepe on a work surface.
          Place a dollop of cream just below halfway. Spread the cream so it's
          about 1cm/1/3â€³ thick, a smidge larger than the shape of the mango
          piece. Top with mango.
        </li>
        <li>Fold the bottom up to cover the mango.</li>
        <li>Fold the sides in.</li>
        <li>Continue rolling, firmly but gently.</li>
        <li>Finish with the seam side down.</li>
        <li>
          And that's it, you're done. YOU JUST MADE MANGO PANCAKES, you cooking
          goddess! (Or god)
        </li>
      </ol>
    </ol>
