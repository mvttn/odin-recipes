    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Mochi ice cream is a small, round confection consisting of a soft, pounded
      sticky rice dumpling (mochi) formed around an ice cream filling. The ice
      cream adds flavor and creaminess to the confection while the mochi adds
      sweetness and texture.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Glutinous rice flour</strong> (sweet rice flour- I used Mochiko
        but you can also use shiratamako). Regular flour will not work for this
        recipe!
      </li>
      <li>Water</li>
      <li>Sugar</li>
      <li>Powdered sugar</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cornstarch</strong> or potato starch - to help with the
        stickiness of the dough.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Freeze ice cream balls:</strong> Place a piece of parchment
        paper on a cookie sheet. Working quickly, use a small ice cream scoop to
        scoop ice cream balls and place them on the parchment paper. Be sure to
        pack the ice cream tightly in the scooper, leaving a flat edge on the
        ice cream so that it will sit flat on your cookie sheet. Freeze for 1
        hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Make mochi:</strong> Combine flour, sugar, and powdered sugar in
        a microwave safe bowl. Add water and stir well, until smooth. Cover the
        bowl with plastic wrap and microwave mochi dough for 1 minute. Wet your
        spatula to prevent sticking and use your spatula to repeatedly fold the
        mixture. Cover, and microwave again for 1 minute. Fold the dough again
        and microwave for 30 more seconds. The mochi should look slightly shiny
        and if it doesn't, microwave for 30 more seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Roll mochi dough into rectangle"</strong> Place a piece of
        parchment paper on the counter and dust it with a layer of cornstarch.
        Use a rubber spatula to scrape the mochi dough from the bowl and onto
        the parchment paper (keep in mind that it will be very hot so be careful
        not to touch it). Dust the top of the dough ball with cornstarch. Use a
        rolling pin to roll the mochi dough into a large rectangle, about ¼ inch
        thick. If the dough sticks at all while rolling, continue to dust the
        top with cornstarch to prevent sticking. Place the parchment paper with
        the rolled out dough on it, onto the cookie sheet and refrigerate for 30
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Fill mochi with ice cream:</strong> Remove the dough from the
        fridge and use a round biscuit cutter (about 3 inches) to cut circles in
        the dough. Your circles need to be big enough to pinch the dough around
        the ice cream. Pick up one circle of dough and gently brush off the
        cornstarch from the top (I like to use a dry pastry brush to do this).
        Working with one scoop of ice cream at a time, (keep the rest in the
        freezer so they don’t melt), place one ice cream scoop in the center of
        the mochi and gently press the dough around the ice cream. Pinch the
        edges of the mochi to seal it. Place mochi on a piece of plastic wrap
        bringing the corners of the plastic wrap to the center and twisting it
        tightly at the top.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Freeze:</strong> Place mochi back in the freezer with the rolled
        plastic wrap side down. Continue with remaining dough and ice cream.
        Freeze mochi ice cream for at least 1 hour before eating. Once it's
        frozen, store it wrapped in the plastic wrap and in a freezer safe bag
        or container in the freezer for up to 3 months.
        <strong>Allow the dough to thaw slightly before eating.</strong>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Recipe Variations:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Vary the ice cream flavors:</strong> any flavor ice cream or
        sorbet will work!
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Swap the filling:</strong> instead of ice cream you could fill
        the center with nutella, chocolate, fresh cut strawberries, peanut
        butter, or traditional red bean paste (anko).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Flavor the dough:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Peanut butter: Mix in 2 Tablespoons of peanut butter right after the
            dough has steamed in the microwave.
          </li>
          <li>
            Chocolate/Cocoa Powder: Mix in 1 teaspoon cocoa powder before
            cooking.
          </li>
          <li>Matcha: Mix in 1 teaspoon matcha (green tea powder).</li>
          <li>
            Vanilla: Add one teaspoons of vanilla extract to dough before
            cooking.
          </li>
          <li>
            Coconut: Add 1 Tablespoon coconut milk to the dough before cooking
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
