    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Mochi ice cream is a small, round confection consisting of a soft, pounded
      sticky rice dumpling (mochi) formed around an ice cream filling. The ice
      cream adds flavor and creaminess to the confection while the mochi adds
      sweetness and texture.
