    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Protein shakes (or protein smoothies) are a protein drink typically
      consumed before or after a workout in order to aid in muscle recovery.
      Protein shakes are usually made with frozen fruit/ice, a protein source
      such as protein powder, and a liquid.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Protein powder</li>
      <li>Nuts/Nut butter</li>
      <li>Seeds</li>
      <li>Fruit/Veggies</li>
      <li>Other protein sources</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Base - Fruit vs. Ice:</strong> Start with a base of around 1 cup
        of ice or 1 cup of frozen fruit. My favorite base is frozen banana, but
        mixed berries are a close second. Add it right into your high-speed
        blender.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Protein:</strong> Next, choose your protein source(s). We
        typically use multiple protein sources when making a protein shake. For
        example, you could do a serving of protein powder + a teaspoon of
        chia/flax seed + a tablespoon of nut butter.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sweetener:</strong> Now, decide if you'd like to add a
        sweetener. Depending on how sweet your protein powder is or what base
        fruit you used, you may not need to add one! If you are going to add
        one, we suggest an all-natural sweetener such as maple syrup or honey.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Liquid:</strong> Start with about 1/3 cup to 1/2 cup of liquid
        and add more from there. There's nothing worse than a protein shake
        that's too runny, so start conservatively. Feel free to use any liquid
        you like such as water, orange juice, almond milk, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Blend:</strong> Now it's time to blend it all up! The better the
        blender, the smoother your protein shake is going to be! If things are
        having a hard time “smoothing,” this means you need to add more liquid.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>ENJOY YOUR PROTEIN SHAKE!</strong>
      </li>
    </ol>
