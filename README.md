# odin-recipes

I will be demonstrating the skills I have learnt so far through the development of a basic recipe website.

What skills have I demonstrated?

- Use of different tags such has various headings, ordered and unordered lists and their subsequent elements
- Use of <strong> to emphasize different parts of recipes
- Implementation of images and remembering to include the alternate text attribute
